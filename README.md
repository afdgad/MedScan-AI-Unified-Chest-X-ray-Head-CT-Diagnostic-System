# MedScan-AI-Unified-Chest-X-ray-Head-CT-Diagnostic-System

In this Project I had create Unified-Chest-X-ray-Head-CT-Diagnostic-System in which I m using two self trained models Which i had trained through transfer learning. For chest X-ray I had trained my dataset on DenseNet121 firstly I freeze the final layyer of DenseNet121 model then I trained it on my dataset and For Head X-ray I had used ResNet50 because its better for segmentation and as well as in detection that why i use it . I freeze the final layyer of ResNet50 model then I trained my multidetection dataset for Head-ct scan and bone fracture on this model.
